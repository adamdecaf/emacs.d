# emacs.d

> The emacs setup I use. Lots of stuff here is copy/pasted from others.

### TODO

- [ ] Rename everything under names like `mine/`, `backline/`, `banno/` etc
- [ ] Remove old packages, remove ones I don't use.
- [ ] Setup docker (dev-setup) as part of the config.
- [ ] Remove old functions I don't use anymore.
- [ ] Cleanup directory structure of files / names
